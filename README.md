# Age-Of-Empires-4-Stats

Age of empires 4 is a ranked competitive video game. The game consists of different civilizations you and your enemy can pick and also lots of different maps. So I made an app that takes users' information about the match (the civilization that you and your enemy picked, the map you played on and did you win or not) and stores it inside a SQLite database. Then I use that information to display the win rate on certain maps or against certain civilizations in a table to give the player more information about his playstyle or where he needs to improve. The application also shows the total games played and win rate in percentages. The application uses the same colors and styling the video game uses.

The program is made in Java using JAVAFX, JAVAFX SceneBuilder, SQLite, JDBC, and a bit of CSS styling.

### To run the Classical Composers application:

Download the repository.

Open the project with IntelliJ using JDK19 and wait until IntelliJ indexes and downloads all the needed files.

Run the application using the main method inside AgeOfEmpires4LadderStats\src\main\java\com\example\ageofempires4ladderstats.java

I hope you enjoy some of my favourite music made by my favourite composers!
